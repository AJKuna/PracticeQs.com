      "question": "A student reacts 2.76g of sodium hydroxide with excess sulfuric acid. The equation for the reaction is:\n2NaOH + H₂SO₄ → Na₂SO₄ + 2H₂O\nCalculate the theoretical yield of sodium sulfate in grams. (Ar: Na=23, O=16, H=1, S=32)",
      "answer": "1. Mr NaOH = 23 + 16 + 1 = 40\n2. Mr Na₂SO₄ = (2 × 23) + 32 + (4 × 16) = 142\n3. Moles NaOH = 2.76/40 = 0.069 moles\n4. Ratio NaOH:Na₂SO₄ = 2:1, so moles Na₂SO₄ = 0.069/2 = 0.0345\n5. Mass Na₂SO₄ = 0.0345 × 142 = 4.90g",

      "question": "The Haber process produces ammonia according to the equation:\nN₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g)     ΔH = -92kJ/mol\n\nExplain in detail how the following conditions affect both yield and rate, and why the industrial conditions (450°C, 200 atmospheres pressure, iron catalyst) are used:\na) Temperature\nb) Pressure\nc) Catalyst",
      "answer": "Temperature:\n1. Reaction is exothermic, so lower temperature increases yield\n2. But lower temperature decreases rate\n3. 450°C is compromise between rate and yield\n\nPressure:\n1. High pressure increases yield (fewer gas molecules on right)\n2. High pressure increases rate (more frequent collisions)\n3. 200 atm is compromise due to cost of higher pressures\n\nCatalyst:\n1. Iron catalyst provides alternative reaction pathway\n2. Lower activation energy so increases rate\n3. No effect on position of equilibrium/yield\n4. Iron chosen as cheap and effective",
