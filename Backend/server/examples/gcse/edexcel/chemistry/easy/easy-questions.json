      "question": "State the three states of matter and give one property of each.",
      "answer": "1. Solid - fixed shape and volume\n2. Liquid - fixed volume but takes shape of container\n3. Gas - no fixed shape or volume",
      "explanation": "The states of matter differ in their particle arrangement and movement, which gives them different properties.",

      "id": "E2",
      "topic": "Atomic structure",
      "question": "Name the three subatomic particles and state where they are found in an atom.",
      "answer": "1. Protons - in nucleus\n2. Neutrons - in nucleus\n3. Electrons - in shells/energy levels around nucleus",
      "explanation": "The nucleus contains protons and neutrons, while electrons orbit in shells around the nucleus.",

      "question": "What is the name given to elements in Group 1 of the periodic table?",
      "answer": "Alkali metals",
      "explanation": "Group 1 elements are called alkali metals because they form alkaline solutions when they react with water.",

      "question": "Name the elements in Group 0 of the periodic table.",
      "answer": "Noble gases/Inert gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, radon)",
      "explanation": "Group 0 elements are called noble gases because they are unreactive due to their full outer shell of electrons.",

      "id": "E6",
      "topic": "Separating mixtures",
      "question": "What separation technique would you use to separate salt from rock salt?",
      "answer": "Dissolve in water, filter to remove rock/sand, then evaporate the water",
      "explanation": "This process uses solubility differences - salt dissolves in water while rock doesn't.",
