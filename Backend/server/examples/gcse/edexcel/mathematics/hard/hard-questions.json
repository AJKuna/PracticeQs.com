      "question": "A rectangle has length (x + 3) cm and width (x - 1) cm. Given that its area is 40 cm², find the length of its perimeter.",
      "answer": "26 cm",
      "explanation": "1. Area = length × width\n   (x + 3)(x - 1) = 40\n2. Expand: x² + 2x - 3 = 40\n3. Rearrange: x² + 2x - 43 = 0\n4. Solve quadratic: x = 5 or x = -7\n5. Since width must be positive, x = 5\n6. Length = 8 cm, width = 5 cm\n7. Perimeter = 2(8 + 5) = 26 cm",
