      "answer": "nth term = 3n² - 4n + 2",
      "explanation": "1. First differences: 5, 11, 17, 23... (1 mark)\n2. Second differences: 6, 6, 6... (constant, confirms quadratic) (1 mark)\n3. Since 2nd diff = 6, coefficient of n² is 6÷2 = 3 (1 mark)\n4. Compare with 3n²: 1-3=-2, 6-12=-6, 17-27=-10, 34-48=-14... (1 mark)\n5. This gives -2, -6, -10, -14... = -2(1, 3, 5, 7...) = -2(2n-1) = -4n+2 (1 mark)\n6. Therefore nth term = 3n² + (-4n+2) = 3n² - 4n + 2 (1 mark)",

      "answer": "a = 2, b = 1, c = 1",
      "explanation": "1. Set up equations using given terms:\n   n=1: a + b + c = 4 (1 mark)\n   n=2: 4a + 2b + c = 11 (1 mark)\n   n=3: 9a + 3b + c = 22 (1 mark)\n2. Subtract equation 1 from 2: 3a + b = 7 (1 mark)\n3. Subtract equation 2 from 3: 5a + b = 11 (1 mark)\n4. Subtract: 2a = 4, so a = 2 (1 mark)\n5. Substitute back: b = 1, c = 1 (1 mark)\nVerify: 2n² + n + 1 gives 4, 11, 22 ✓",

      "answer": "26 cm",
      "explanation": "1. Area = length × width\n   (x + 3)(x - 1) = 40\n2. Expand: x² + 2x - 3 = 40\n3. Rearrange: x² + 2x - 43 = 0\n4. Solve quadratic: x = 5 or x = -7\n5. Since width must be positive, x = 5\n6. Length = 8 cm, width = 5 cm\n7. Perimeter = 2(8 + 5) = 26 cm",
