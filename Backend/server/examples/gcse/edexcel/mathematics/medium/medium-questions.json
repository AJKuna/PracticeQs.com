      "answer": "x = -2 or x = -3",
      "explanation": "1. Factorize: x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)\n2. Set each bracket to zero: x + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0\n3. Solve: x = -2 or x = -3",

      "answer": "15 cm²",
      "explanation": "Using the formula Area = ½ab sin C\nArea = ½ × 5 × 12 × sin 30°\n= ½ × 5 × 12 × 0.5\n= 15",
