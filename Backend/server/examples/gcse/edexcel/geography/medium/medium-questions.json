    "answer": "1. Warm air rises at the equator creating low pressure and high rainfall. 2. Cool air sinks at 30°N and 30°S creating high pressure and dry conditions. 3. Trade winds blow from high pressure areas towards the equatorial low pressure zone.",

    "question": "Explain why people continue to live in areas at risk from volcanic eruptions.",
    "answer": "People continue to live near volcanoes because volcanic soils are very fertile and excellent for farming, providing good agricultural income. Many people cannot afford to move elsewhere and may lack alternative employment opportunities. Family and cultural ties keep communities together in familiar areas. Some people may not fully understand the risks or believe eruptions are unlikely to happen in their lifetime.",

    "question": "Describe the characteristics of a tropical rainforest ecosystem.",
    "answer": "Tropical rainforests have extremely high biodiversity with thousands of species of plants and animals. They have a layered structure from forest floor to emergent layer. The climate is hot (25-30°C) and wet (over 2000mm rainfall annually) throughout the year. Nutrient cycling is rapid with quick decomposition of organic matter. Soils are generally thin and nutrient-poor as nutrients are stored in the vegetation.",

    "question": "Explain how glaciers shape the landscape through erosion.",
    "answer": "Glaciers erode the landscape through plucking, where ice freezes to bedrock and pulls away loose rock when it moves. Abrasion occurs when rock debris frozen in the glacier acts like sandpaper, scraping and wearing away the underlying rock. These processes create distinctive landforms including U-shaped valleys, corries, arêtes, and pyramidal peaks. The power of glacial erosion can carve deep valleys and create dramatic mountain landscapes.",

    "question": "Explain how rapid urbanisation creates challenges for cities in emerging countries.",
    "answer": "Rapid urbanisation creates housing shortages leading to the growth of squatter settlements or slums with poor living conditions and lack of basic services. Infrastructure such as water supply, sewerage, and electricity cannot keep pace with population growth, leading to inadequate provision. Job creation cannot match the influx of migrants, resulting in high unemployment and growth of the informal economy. Public services like healthcare and education become overcrowded and under-resourced. Environmental problems increase including air pollution, waste management issues, and traffic congestion.",

Infrastructure development improves transport links, communication, and power supply. Foreign investment brings new technology and skills. GDP growth improves the country's international status. Disadvantages include increased income inequality between rich and poor. Environmental degradation from oil extraction and industrial pollution. Loss of traditional ways of life and cultural changes. Dependence on volatile oil prices affecting economic stability.",

    "answer": "1. Rising sea levels may cause increased coastal flooding, particularly affecting low-lying areas like East Anglia. 2. Higher temperatures may lead to more frequent heat waves, affecting human health and increasing energy demand for cooling. 3. Changes in precipitation patterns may cause more frequent droughts in summer and increased flood risk in winter.",

Reforestation programs plant new trees to replace those that have been cut down, ensuring forest cover is maintained for future generations.",

    "answer": "Using the UK as an example: Energy security can be improved by diversifying energy sources to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels. Investing in renewable energy like wind and solar power provides sustainable domestic energy production. Improving energy efficiency in buildings and transport reduces overall energy demand. Developing nuclear power provides reliable baseload electricity. Creating strategic energy reserves and improving international cooperation through energy partnerships help ensure supply security during crises.",

    "question": "Describe the process of coastal transportation.",
    "answer": "Coastal transportation moves sediment along the coastline through longshore drift. Waves approach the beach at an angle due to the prevailing wind direction. The swash carries sediment up the beach at an angle. The backwash carries sediment straight back down the beach due to gravity. This creates a zigzag movement of sediment along the coast. The process is influenced by wave energy, wind direction, and the size of sediment particles.",

    "answer": "Fieldwork allows geographers to collect primary data directly from the environment, providing accurate and up-to-date information. It enables measurement of processes as they occur, such as monitoring river flow or coastal erosion rates. Fieldwork helps verify or challenge theoretical models and concepts learned in the classroom. It develops practical skills in data collection, measurement techniques, and the use of geographical equipment. Working in real environments helps geographers understand the complexity of natural systems and the interactions between different factors.",
