    "question": "Explain why tropical cyclones lose strength when they move over land.",
    "answer": "Tropical cyclones lose strength over land because they are cut off from their energy source - warm ocean water. The warm ocean provides the energy through evaporation that fuels the storm. Over land, there is increased friction and no warm water source, so the cyclone weakens rapidly.",

    "id": 10,
    "question": "Describe the formation of a river meander.",
    "answer": "A meander forms when a river flows around a bend. The water moves faster on the outside of the bend, causing erosion of the riverbank. On the inside of the bend, the water moves slower and deposits sediment, forming a slip-off slope. Over time, this process creates the characteristic curved shape of a meander.",

    "id": 11,
    "question": "Explain why deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests.",
    "answer": "Deforestation occurs for several reasons: commercial logging provides valuable timber for export and income for countries. Cattle ranching requires large areas of cleared land for grazing. Agricultural expansion for crops like soy and palm oil is profitable. Growing populations need more land for settlements and infrastructure development.",

    "question": "Describe how renewable energy can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "answer": "Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power produce electricity without burning fossil fuels. This reduces carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming. As renewable energy becomes cheaper and more efficient, it can replace coal and gas power stations, significantly reducing a country's carbon footprint.",
