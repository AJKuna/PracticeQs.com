      "question": "A student investigated the effect of temperature on enzyme activity using the following method:\n1. Set up water baths at different temperatures\n2. Add equal volumes of amylase solution to test tubes\n3. Add equal volumes of starch solution\n4. Time how long it takes for the starch to be broken down\n\na) Identify two variables that should be controlled in this investigation. (2 marks)\nb) Explain why the student should repeat the experiment at each temperature. (2 marks)\nc) The student's results showed an optimum temperature of 37°C. Explain in detail why enzyme activity decreases above this temperature. (6 marks)",
