    "question": "An atom has 17 protons, 18 neutrons and 17 electrons. State the atomic number, mass number, and identify the element.",
    "answer": "Atomic number = 17 (number of protons). Mass number = 35 (17 protons + 18 neutrons). The element is chlorine (Cl) as it has 17 protons.",

    "question": "Explain how the atomic model changed from Dalton's model to Bohr's model.",
    "answer": "Dalton's model described atoms as indivisible solid spheres. Thomson discovered electrons and proposed the 'plum pudding' model with electrons embedded in positive material. Rutherford's experiments showed atoms have a small, dense nucleus. Bohr then proposed that electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed energy levels or shells.",

    "question": "A student wants to separate a mixture of salt and sand. Describe the method they should use and explain why it works.",
    "answer": "Method: 1) Add water to dissolve the salt. 2) Filter to separate the sand (insoluble). 3) Evaporate the water from the filtrate to obtain pure salt crystals. This works because salt is soluble in water while sand is insoluble, allowing physical separation based on solubility differences.",

    "answer": "The equation is already balanced: CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂. This is a thermal decomposition reaction because one compound (calcium carbonate) breaks down into two simpler compounds when heated.",

    "answer": "Balanced equation: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O. Moles of HCl = 0.1 × 25/1000 = 0.0025 mol. Moles of NaOH = 0.1 × 25/1000 = 0.0025 mol. The reaction is 1:1 stoichiometry, so reactants are in exact proportions.",

    "question": "Explain the trend in reactivity down Group 1 of the periodic table and predict what would happen if cesium reacted with water.",
    "answer": "Reactivity increases down Group 1 because atoms get larger, so the outer electron is further from the nucleus and easier to lose. Cesium would react very vigorously with water, producing cesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas, with a violent reaction that might cause explosion: 2Cs + 2H₂O → 2CsOH + H₂",

    "question": "Explain why increasing the surface area of a solid reactant increases the rate of reaction.",
    "answer": "Increasing surface area increases the rate of reaction because more particles are exposed on the surface. This means there are more collision opportunities between reactant particles per unit time. More collisions lead to more successful reactions, increasing the overall rate of reaction.",

    "question": "For the reversible reaction N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃, predict what happens to the equilibrium position when the pressure is increased.",
    "answer": "When pressure is increased, the equilibrium position shifts to the right (towards products). This is because there are 4 gas molecules on the left (1 N₂ + 3 H₂) and only 2 gas molecules on the right (2 NH₃). The equilibrium shifts to the side with fewer gas molecules to reduce pressure.",
