    "answer": "Moles of Mg = 4.8 ÷ 24 = 0.2 mol. From equation: 2 mol Mg needs 1 mol O₂, so 0.2 mol Mg needs 0.1 mol O₂. Mass of O₂ = 0.1 × 32 = 3.2 g. 2 mol Mg produces 2 mol MgO, so 0.2 mol Mg produces 0.2 mol MgO. Mass of MgO = 0.2 × 40 = 8.0 g",

At the anode (positive electrode): Cu → Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ (copper atoms lose electrons and are oxidised to copper ions). The copper anode dissolves while copper is deposited on the cathode.",

    "answer": "Reactivity in Group 7 decreases down the group. Chlorine (2,8,7) is more reactive than bromine (2,8,18,7) because chlorine atoms are smaller, so the outer electron shell is closer to the nucleus. This means chlorine atoms attract electrons more strongly when forming bonds. Bromine is more reactive than iodine (2,8,18,18,7) for the same reason - bromine atoms are smaller than iodine atoms, so they can attract electrons more easily.",

    "answer": "Although lower temperatures would favor the forward reaction (Le Chatelier's principle for exothermic reactions), they would make the reaction rate extremely slow. At 450°C, there is a reasonable compromise between having a good reaction rate and still achieving acceptable yield. Industrial processes need to balance yield with reaction rate to be economically viable.",

    "answer": "CuCO₃ → CuO + CO₂. Mr of CuCO₃ = 64 + 12 + 48 = 124. Moles of CuCO₃ = 12.4 ÷ 124 = 0.10 mol. From equation: 1 mol CuCO₃ produces 1 mol CO₂. So 0.10 mol CuCO₃ produces 0.10 mol CO₂. Volume of CO₂ = 0.10 × 24 = 2.4 dm³",

    "answer": "Catalysts work by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy. They do this by forming temporary bonds with reactant molecules, weakening existing bonds and making it easier for new bonds to form. Catalysts are not consumed in the reaction.
