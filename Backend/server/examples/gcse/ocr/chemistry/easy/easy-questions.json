    "question": "Name the three states of matter and describe the arrangement of particles in each state.",
    "answer": "The three states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. In solids, particles are closely packed in a regular arrangement. In liquids, particles are close together but can move past each other. In gases, particles are far apart and move freely.",
