      "answer": "x = 5",
      "explanation": "1. Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 22 - 7 = 15\n2. Divide both sides by 3: x = 15 ÷ 3 = 5",

      "explanation": "1. First differences: 5, 9, 13, 17... (1 mark)\n2. Second differences: 4, 4, 4... (constant, so quadratic) (1 mark)\n3. Since 2nd diff = 4, coefficient of n² is 4÷2 = 2 (1 mark)\n4. Compare with 2n²: 4-2=2, 9-8=1, 18-18=0, 31-32=-1... (1 mark)\n5.
