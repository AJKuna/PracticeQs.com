    "question": "A sealed container holds 0.5 m³ of gas at 20°C and 150 kPa. The gas is heated to 100°C while keeping the volume constant. Calculate the new pressure and explain the particle theory behind this change.",
    "answer": "Using Gay-Lussac's law: P₁/T₁ = P₂/T₂. Convert to Kelvin: T₁ = 20 + 273 = 293 K, T₂ = 100 + 273 = 373 K. P₂ = P₁ × T₂/T₁ = 150 × 373/293 = 191 kPa. Explanation: As temperature increases, particles move faster and collide with container walls more frequently and with greater force, increasing pressure.",

    "answer": "Using v² = u² + 2as: 0² = 30² + 2a(90), so a = -900/180 = -5 m/s². Braking force = ma = 1200 × 5 = 6000 N. Using v = u + at: 0 = 30 + (-5)t, so t = 6 s",

    "answer": "Parallel combination: 1/R_parallel = 1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8, so R_parallel = 8/3 Ω. Total resistance = 6 + 8/3 = 26/3 Ω. Total current = 12 ÷ (26/3) = 36/26 = 1.38 A. Voltage across parallel section = 12 - (1.38 × 6) = 3.72 V. Current through 4 Ω = 3.72/4 = 0.93 A. Current through 8 Ω = 3.72/8 = 0.47 A",

    "answer": "Using Snell's law: n₁sin θ₁ = n₂sin θ₂. 1.0 × sin 45° = 1.5 × sin θ₂. sin θ₂ = sin 45°/1.5 = 0.707/1.5 = 0.471. θ₂ = arcsin(0.471) = 28.1°. The light bends toward the normal because it's entering a denser medium where it travels slower, causing the wavefronts to bunch up and change direction.",

Short half-lives are preferred because they reduce the patient's exposure to radiation, minimizing health risks while providing sufficient time for the medical procedure.",

    "answer": "The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is electromagnetic radiation left over from the Big Bang, detected uniformly across the universe. It supports the Big Bang theory because: 1) It shows the universe was once much hotter and denser, 2) Its temperature (2.7 K) matches theoretical predictions, 3) Small temperature variations explain how galaxies formed. The CMB tells us the universe began in a hot, dense state and has been expanding and cooling for ~13.8 billion years.",

    "answer": "The waves will undergo diffraction as they pass through the gap. Since the gap (1 cm) is smaller than the wavelength (3 cm), significant diffraction occurs. The waves spread out in semicircular patterns after passing through the gap. This demonstrates that waves can bend around obstacles and through gaps, with maximum diffraction occurring when the gap size is similar to or smaller than the wavelength.",
