    "question": "A gas has a volume of 2.0 m³ at a pressure of 100 kPa. If the temperature remains constant, calculate the new pressure when the volume is compressed to 0.5 m³.",
    "answer": "Using p₁V₁ = p₂V₂: 100 kPa × 2.0 m³ = p₂ × 0.5 m³. Therefore p₂ = (100 × 2.0) ÷ 0.5 = 400 kPa",

    "answer": "An electromagnet works by passing electric current through a coil of wire wrapped around an iron core. The current creates a magnetic field, and the iron core becomes magnetized, strengthening the field. When the current is switched off, the magnetism disappears. Application: Electric bells, MRI machines, or scrapyard cranes.",

    "answer": "Redshift occurs when distant galaxies are moving away from us, stretching the wavelength of light and making it appear redder. This provides evidence that the universe is expanding, supporting the Big Bang theory. The greater the redshift, the faster the galaxy is moving away.",

    "answer": "Brownian motion is the random, erratic movement of small particles suspended in a fluid. It occurs because the particles are constantly being hit by moving molecules of the fluid. This provides evidence that particles in fluids are in constant random motion and that temperature is related to the kinetic energy of particles.",
