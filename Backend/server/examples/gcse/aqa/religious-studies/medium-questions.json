      "topic": "Theme A: Relationships and families",
      "answer": [

        "Second belief: Marriage should be permanent and indissoluble (1) as Jesus taught 'what God has joined together, let no one separate' (Mark 10:9) (1), meaning divorce goes against God's will (1)"

      "topic": "Theme B: Religion and life", 
      "answer": [
        "First attitude: Some Christians oppose abortion in all circumstances (1) because they believe life begins at conception, and the commandment 'You shall not murder' (Exodus 20:13) (1) applies to unborn life as it is sacred to God (1)",
        "Second attitude: Some religious believers accept abortion in extreme circumstances (1) following the principle of lesser evil, where saving the mother's life takes priority (1) as Islamic teaching permits abortion to save the mother's life (1)"
