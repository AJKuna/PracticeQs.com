      "question": "'Religion is the most important influence on moral behaviour.' Evaluate this statement. In your answer you should: • give reasoned arguments to support this statement • give reasoned arguments to support a different point of view • reach a justified conclusion.",
      "marks": 12,
      "topic": "Theme A: Relationships and families",
      "answer": [
        "Arguments supporting the statement:",
        "Religion provides clear moral guidelines through sacred texts like the Ten Commandments, which give specific rules about how to behave (2 marks)",
        "Religious communities offer support and accountability, helping people to live according to moral principles and providing consequences for wrongdoing (2 marks)",
        "Many religious believers find that their faith gives them strength to do what is right even when it is difficult, as they believe God is watching and will judge their actions (2 marks)",
        "",
        "Arguments against the statement:",
        "Secular ethics and philosophy can provide equally valid moral frameworks without needing religious belief, as shown by humanist approaches to morality (2 marks)",
        "Some people argue that conscience and reason are more important than religious teaching, as individuals can work out right and wrong through thinking rather than following rules (2 marks)",
        "Religious teachings sometimes conflict with modern moral understanding, such as attitudes to gender equality or sexual orientation (2 marks)",
        "",
        "Conclusion:",
        "While religion remains a significant influence on moral behaviour for many people, it is not necessarily the most important influence for everyone. Personal conscience, family upbringing, and secular ethical systems can be equally or more influential depending on the individual and their circumstances."

      "explanation": "This is a 12-mark evaluation question (+3 SPaG marks = 15 total). Students must present arguments for and against the statement, use religious and non-religious perspectives, and reach a justified conclusion."

      "question": "'Scientific theories about the origins of the universe prove that God does not exist.' Evaluate this statement. In your answer you should: • give reasoned arguments to support this statement • give reasoned arguments to support a different point of view • reach a justified conclusion.",

      "topic": "Theme B: Religion and life",
      "answer": [
        "Arguments supporting the statement:",
        "Scientific theories like the Big Bang provide natural explanations for how the universe began without needing God as a cause (2 marks)",
        "The theory of evolution shows how life developed through natural processes rather than divine creation, removing the need for a creator God (2 marks)",
        "As science advances, it explains more phenomena that were previously attributed to God, suggesting God was just used to explain the unknown (2 marks)",
        "",
        "Arguments against the statement:",
        "Many religious believers argue that God could have used scientific processes like the Big Bang and evolution as the method of creation, so science and religion are compatible (2 marks)",
        "The complexity and fine-tuning of the universe for life suggests intelligent design, with the precise conditions needed for life being too perfect to be coincidental (2 marks)",
        "Science can explain how things happen but not why they happen or why anything exists at all, which are questions that religion addresses (2 marks)",
        "",
        "Conclusion:",
        "Scientific theories provide convincing natural explanations for the origins of the universe, but they do not definitively prove or disprove God's existence. Many people successfully reconcile scientific and religious worldviews, while others find science sufficient to explain existence without needing religious explanations."

      "explanation": "This is a 12-mark evaluation question requiring balanced arguments about science and religion, with reference to specific theories and religious responses."
