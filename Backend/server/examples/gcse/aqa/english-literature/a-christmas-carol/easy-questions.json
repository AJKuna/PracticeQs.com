      "question": "Starting with this extract, how does Dickens present Scrooge as an outsider to society?",
      "extract": "External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty.",
      "marks": 30,
      "answer": "In this extract, Dickens presents Scrooge as isolated from society through:\n1. Weather imagery comparing him to harsh elements shows his cold nature\n2. Repetition of 'no' emphasizes his resistance to human warmth and connection\n3. The metaphor of being colder than winter itself suggests his complete separation from humanity\n\nIn the wider novel:\n1. His refusal to attend Fred's Christmas dinner\n2. His treatment of the charity collectors\n3. His isolated lifestyle in his counting house",
      "explanation": "This question requires analysis of how Dickens uses language and imagery to show Scrooge's isolation, then linking to other moments in the novel where his outsider status is shown."

      "question": "How does Dickens present the theme of poverty in A Christmas Carol?",
      "extract": "They were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish... 'This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree.'",
      "marks": 30,
      "answer": "Dickens presents poverty as a serious social issue:\n1. Personification of Ignorance and Want as children makes the message more emotional\n2. Adjectives 'yellow, meagre, ragged' emphasize their desperate condition\n3. The word 'wolfish' suggests poverty has made them dangerous and desperate\n\nIn the wider novel:\n1. The Cratchit family's struggles\n2. Bob Cratchit's low wages\n3. The contrast between rich and poor at Christmas time",
      "explanation": "This question asks you to analyze how Dickens uses language and symbolism to criticize Victorian society's treatment of the poor."

      "question": "How does Dickens present the Ghost of Christmas Past?",
      "extract": "It was a strange figure â€“ like a child: yet not so like a child as like an old man... Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it.",
      "marks": 30,
      "answer": "Dickens presents the ghost as a complex and contradictory figure:\n1. Paradoxical description combining youth and age shows its supernatural nature\n2. The white hair symbolizes wisdom and experience\n3. The childlike appearance connects to memories and innocence\n\nIn the wider novel:\n1. The ghost's role in showing Scrooge his past\n2. Its effect on Scrooge's emotional journey\n3. The light emanating from its head symbolizing truth and revelation",
      "explanation": "This question requires analysis of how Dickens uses description and symbolism to create a meaningful supernatural character."
