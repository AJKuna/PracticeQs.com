      "question": "Starting with this extract, how does Stevenson present Mr Hyde as a frightening character?",
      "extract": "Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a displeasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky, whispering and somewhat broken voice.",
      "marks": 30,
      "answer": "Stevenson presents Hyde as frightening through:\n1. Physical description suggesting deformity without specifics, creating unease\n2. Contradictory qualities ('timidity and boldness') making him unpredictable\n3. His voice description ('husky, whispering') adding to his sinister nature\n\nIn the wider novel:\n1. His violent actions like trampling the child\n2. The visceral reactions of those who see him\n3. The mystery surrounding his appearance and behavior",
      "explanation": "This question requires analysis of how Stevenson uses description and other characters' reactions to create a frightening character."

    {
      "question": "How does Stevenson present Victorian society in the novel?",
      "extract": "The large handsome face of Dr Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes. 'I do not care to hear more,' said he. 'This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.'",
      "marks": 30,
      "answer": "Stevenson presents Victorian society as repressive:\n1. Jekyll's physical reaction shows fear of scandal\n2. His abrupt ending of the conversation suggests the need to hide uncomfortable truths\n3. The formal language ('I do not care to hear more') masks emotional turmoil\n\nIn the wider novel:\n1. The importance of reputation and respectability\n2. The suppression of natural desires\n3. The hypocrisy of upper-class Victorian gentlemen",
      "explanation": "This question asks you to analyze how Stevenson criticizes Victorian values and society through the novel."

    {
      "question": "How does Stevenson present the theme of duality in the novel?",
      "extract": "With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth... that man is not truly one, but truly two.",
      "marks": 30,
      "answer": "Stevenson presents duality as fundamental to human nature:\n1. Direct statement of the theme ('man is not truly one, but truly two')\n2. Reference to both 'moral and intellectual' aspects showing complete division\n3. The gradual revelation ('drew steadily nearer') suggesting the significance of this truth\n\nIn the wider novel:\n1. The physical transformation between Jekyll and Hyde\n2. The contrast between public and private lives\n3. The battle between good and evil within one person",
      "explanation": "This question requires analysis of how Stevenson explores the idea of duality throughout the novel through plot, character, and theme."
