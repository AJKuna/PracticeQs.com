      "question": "How does Priestley present Mr Birling as an unlikeable character?",
      "extract": "But the way some of these cranks talk and write now, you'd think everybody has to look after everybody else, as if we were all mixed up together like bees in a hive – community and all that nonsense.",
      "marks": 30,
      "answer": "Priestley presents Mr Birling as unlikeable through:\n1. His dismissive language ('cranks', 'nonsense') showing his arrogance\n2. The bee metaphor he mocks reveals his rejection of community responsibility\n3. His confident tone suggests he believes he's superior to others\n\nIn the wider play:\n1. His capitalist views contrasting with the Inspector's socialist message\n2. His prioritizing of business reputation over Eva's death\n3. His refusal to learn or change even after the Inspector's revelations",
      "explanation": "This question requires analysis of how Priestley uses Mr Birling to criticize the attitudes of the upper class in 1912."

      "question": "How does Priestley present the theme of responsibility in An Inspector Calls?",
      "extract": "We don't live alone. We are members of one body. We are responsible for each other. And I tell you that the time will soon come when, if men will not learn that lesson, then they will be taught it in fire and blood and anguish.",
      "marks": 30,
      "answer": "Priestley presents responsibility as a crucial moral message:\n1. Short, declarative sentences ('We don't live alone') emphasize the certainty of his message\n2. Body metaphor suggests interconnectedness of society\n3. Threatening final sentence warns of consequences of ignoring social responsibility\n\nIn the wider play:\n1. Each character's individual responsibility for Eva's death\n2. The generational divide in accepting responsibility\n3. The Inspector as Priestley's mouthpiece for social responsibility",

      "question": "How does Priestley present Sheila's character development?",

      "marks": 30,
      "answer": "Priestley presents Sheila's development through:\n1. Her empathetic language about Eva ('hopes and fears')\n2. The contrast between 'girls' (collective) and 'she' (personal) showing her growing understanding\n3. Her recognition of Eva's humanity ('She was a person')\n\nIn the wider play:\n1. Her initial thoughtless behavior in Milwards\n2. Her growing awareness and acceptance of responsibility\n3. Her final rejection of her parents' outdated views",
      "explanation": "This question requires analysis of how Priestley uses Sheila to represent the potential for positive change in the younger generation."
