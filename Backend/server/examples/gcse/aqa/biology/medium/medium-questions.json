      "question": "A student investigated the effect of temperature on the rate of photosynthesis in pondweed. The number of oxygen bubbles produced in one minute was counted at different temperatures.\n\nTemperature (°C): 10, 20, 30, 40, 50\nBubbles per minute: 12, 24, 36, 30, 8\n\na) Plot these results on a graph\nb) Explain the shape of the graph\nc) Suggest the optimum temperature for photosynthesis in this plant",

      "question": "A student investigated osmosis using potato cylinders in different concentrations of sugar solution. Calculate the percentage change in mass for a potato cylinder that had:\nInitial mass = 4.2g\nFinal mass = 4.8g",
      "marks": 4,
      "topic": "Cell Biology",
      "answer": [
        "1. Recall formula: % change = (change in mass ÷ initial mass) × 100 (1)",
        "2. Calculate change in mass: 4.8 - 4.2 = 0.6g (1)",
        "3. Substitute into formula: (0.6 ÷ 4.2) × 100 (1)",
        "4. Calculate correctly: 14.3% increase (1)"
