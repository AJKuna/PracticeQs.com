      "question": "Calculate the magnification of a cell image if the real width of the cell is 0.002mm and the image width is 20mm.",
      "marks": 3,
      "topic": "Cell Biology",
      "answer": [
        "1. Correct formula: magnification = image size ÷ real size (1)",
        "2. Convert units to same scale: 0.002mm = 0.002mm (no conversion needed) (1)",
        "3. Correct calculation: 20 ÷ 0.002 = ×10,000 (1)"
      ],
      "explanation": "This mathematical skills question requires using the magnification formula and handling units correctly."
