    "question": "Explain why earthquakes occur at destructive plate boundaries.",
    "answer": "At destructive plate boundaries, two plates move towards each other. The denser oceanic plate is forced under the continental plate in a process called subduction. As the plates move, friction builds up between them. When this friction is suddenly released, it creates seismic waves that cause earthquakes. The subduction process creates pressure and tension in the rock, which when released causes the ground to shake.",

    "question": "Explain how plants in tropical rainforests are adapted to their environment.",
    "answer": "Plants have large leaves to capture maximum sunlight in the dim forest floor conditions. Drip-tip leaves allow rain to run off quickly to prevent fungal growth. Buttress roots provide stability in shallow soils and help support tall trees. Epiphytes grow on other plants to reach sunlight without competing for ground space.",

    "question": "Explain why cold environments have low biodiversity.",
    "answer": "Cold environments have short growing seasons due to low temperatures for most of the year, limiting plant growth. Harsh conditions with freezing temperatures and strong winds make it difficult for many species to survive. Limited food sources mean fewer animals can be supported. The permafrost prevents deep root growth and limits the types of vegetation that can grow.",
