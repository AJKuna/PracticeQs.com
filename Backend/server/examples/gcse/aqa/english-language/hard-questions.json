      "question": "Analyze how the writer uses structural and linguistic choices to convey the protagonist's psychological deterioration throughout this extract.",
      "marks": 15,
      "extract": "Time. What was time? Minutes stretched like elastic, then snapped back into seconds. The walls pressed closer. Breathe. Just breathe. But the air tasted of copper and regret. 'Pull yourself together,' she whispered, but her voice belonged to someone else now—someone drowning in an ocean of silence.",
      "answer": "The writer skillfully conveys psychological deterioration through:\n\nStructural choices:\n1. Fragmented sentences: 'Time. What was time?' mirrors the protagonist's fractured mental state (3 marks)\n2. Varying sentence lengths: long, complex thoughts interrupted by short, desperate commands ('Breathe. Just breathe.') shows loss of control (3 marks)\n3. Progression from external to internal focus: starts with abstract concept of time, moves to physical sensations, ends with complete disconnection from self (3 marks)\n\nLinguistic choices:\n1. Metaphorical language: 'elastic' time and 'ocean of silence' creates surreal, unstable reality (2 marks)\n2. Synesthesia: 'air tasted of copper' shows confused senses, typical of mental distress (2 marks)\n3. Third person shift: 'her voice belonged to someone else' indicates dissociation and identity loss (2 marks)\n\nThe combination creates a powerful portrayal of mental fragmentation.",
      "explanation": "This question requires sophisticated analysis of how structure and language work together to create psychological effects."

      "question": "Evaluate the effectiveness of both writers' use of narrative perspective in presenting their arguments about social inequality. In your response, you should compare how their different approaches influence reader response.",
      "marks": 20,
      "answer": "Both writers effectively use contrasting narrative perspectives to present arguments about social inequality:\n\nWriter A - First person perspective:\nStrengths:\n1. Creates immediate emotional connection: 'I watched my children go hungry' generates empathy (3 marks)\n2. Authenticates experience: personal testimony carries weight and credibility (3 marks)\n3. Challenges reader directly: 'You cannot understand unless you've lived it' forces uncomfortable self-reflection (3 marks)\n\nLimitations:\n1. Limited scope: single perspective may be seen as unrepresentative (2 marks)\n2. Potential bias: personal involvement could undermine objectivity (2 marks)\n\nWriter B - Third person omniscient:\nStrengths:\n1. Broader social analysis: multiple perspectives provide comprehensive view (3 marks)\n2. Statistical authority: detached tone lends credibility to data presentation (2 marks)\n\nLimitations:\n1. Emotional distance: lacks personal connection that motivates action (2 marks)\n\nConclusion:\nWriter A's personal approach is more effective for emotional engagement and immediate reader response, while Writer B provides necessary context and credibility. The combination of both approaches would be most powerful in addressing social inequality comprehensively.",
      "explanation": "This question demands sophisticated evaluation and comparison of narrative techniques and their impact on audience."

      "question": "Critically evaluate how successfully the writer adapts their register and tone to achieve their purpose across different sections of this speech. Consider the relationship between form and function in your response.",
      "marks": 18,
      "answer": "The writer demonstrates sophisticated control of register and tone, adapting language strategically:\n\nSection 1 - Formal, elevated register:\n1. Latinate vocabulary: 'congregation', 'contemplation', 'veneration' establishes gravity and respect (3 marks)\n2. Complex syntax: subordinate clauses and embedded phrases create measured, thoughtful pace (3 marks)\n3. Function: establishes speaker's credibility and sets appropriate tone for serious subject matter (2 marks)\n\nSection 2 - Informal, colloquial register:\n1. Contractions and dialect: 'didn't', 'gonna', regional expressions create accessibility (3 marks)\n2. Simple, direct sentences: 'This matters. This is real.' emphasize urgency (2 marks)\n3. Function: connects with broader audience, makes complex issues relatable (2 marks)\n\nSection 3 - Rhetorical, elevated register:\n1. Biblical allusions and metaphorical language: 'valley of despair', 'mountain of hope' inspire and motivate (3 marks)\n2. Function: creates emotional climax and call to action (2 marks)\n\nEvaluation:\nThe strategic shifts are highly effective. The formal opening establishes authority, the informal middle section ensures inclusivity, and the rhetorical conclusion provides inspiration. However, the transitions between registers could be smoother—some shifts feel abrupt and potentially alienating to certain audience segments. Overall, the writer demonstrates masterful understanding of how language choices serve communicative purpose.",
      "explanation": "This question requires critical evaluation of sophisticated language choices and their effectiveness for different purposes and audiences."
