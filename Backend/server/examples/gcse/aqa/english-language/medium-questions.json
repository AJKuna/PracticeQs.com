      "marks": 8,

Sensory language: 'floorboards whispered' appeals to hearing, creating mystery (2 marks)",

Uses metaphors of imprisonment: 'chains of expectation', 'trapped by tradition' (2 marks)\n2.

      "marks": 12,
      "answer": "The writer is largely successful in their persuasive purpose:\n\nStrengths:\n1. Uses emotive language: 'devastating destruction', 'innocent wildlife' creates emotional response (3 marks)\n2. Employs statistics: '40% decline in species' provides credible evidence (2 marks)\n3. Direct address: 'you can make a difference' involves the reader personally (2 marks)\n4. Uses rhetorical questions: 'What world will we leave our children?' provokes thought (2 marks)\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. Some arguments lack specific evidence and rely too heavily on emotion (2 marks)\n2. Counter-arguments are not addressed, weakening credibility (1 mark)\n\nOverall, the combination of emotional appeal and factual evidence makes this largely effective persuasive writing.",
