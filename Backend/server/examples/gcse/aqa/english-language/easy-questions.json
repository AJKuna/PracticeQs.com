      "question": "How does the writer use language to describe the character's fear?",
      "marks": 8,
      "extract": "Sarah's heart pounded against her chest like a drum, her hands trembling as she reached for the door handle. The shadows seemed to dance around her, taunting her with every step she took.",
      "answer": "The writer uses several language techniques to convey fear:\n1. Simile: 'heart pounded against her chest like a drum' shows the intensity of her fear through her physical reaction\n2. Physical description: 'hands trembling' demonstrates her nervous state\n3. Personification: 'shadows seemed to dance' and 'taunting her' brings the environment to life in a threatening way",
      "explanation": "This question assesses your ability to analyze language techniques and their effects. Focus on identifying specific techniques and explaining how they create the feeling of fear."

      "marks": 8,
      "answer": "The writer structures the text by:\n1. Opening with an attention-grabbing weather description\n2. Gradually building tension through shorter paragraphs\n3. Using flashbacks to reveal important background information\n4. Ending with a cliff-hanger to maintain reader interest",
      "explanation": "This question tests your understanding of structural features. Look for how the text begins, develops, and ends, and how information is revealed to the reader."
