      "topic": "Bonding",
      "question": "Draw the electronic structure of a chlorine molecule (Cl₂) showing the covalent bond. (Atomic number of Cl = 17)",
      "answer": "Two chlorine atoms each with 2,8,7 electrons, sharing one pair of electrons between them",
      "explanation": "Each chlorine atom shares one electron to achieve a full outer shell of 8 electrons (octet rule).",

      "answer": "74",
      "explanation": "Ca(OH)₂ = 40 + (2 × (16 + 1)) = 40 + (2 × 17) = 40 + 34 = 74",

      "answer": "Diagram showing: reactants energy level higher than products, arrow showing energy change, labels for reactants, products, and energy change",
      "explanation": "The energy of the products is lower than the reactants, and the difference is released as heat energy to the surroundings.",

      "id": "M6",
      "topic": "Rates of reaction",
      "question": "Explain how increasing the surface area of a solid reactant increases the rate of reaction.",
      "answer": "Increasing surface area provides more particles exposed to collisions, leading to more frequent successful collisions between reactants, therefore increasing the rate of reaction",
      "explanation": "More exposed surface area means more particles available for collision at any one time.",
