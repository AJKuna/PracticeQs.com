      "answer": "Rearrange to isolate x: (3 marks)\n1. Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 22 - 7 = 15 (1 mark)\n2. Divide both sides by 3: x = 15 ÷ 3 (1 mark)\n3. Therefore x = 5 (1 mark)",

      "answer": "Use the method for quadratic sequences: (4 marks)\n1. First differences: 5, 9, 13, 17... (1 mark)\n2. Second differences: 4, 4, 4... (constant, so quadratic) (1 mark)\n3. Since 2nd diff = 4, coefficient of n² is 4÷2 = 2 (1 mark)\n4. Compare with 2n²: differences give n-1, so nth term = 2n² + n + 1 (1 mark)",
