      "question": "The nth term of a quadratic sequence is n² + 3n + 1. Find the first 5 terms and explain why the second differences are constant",
      "answer": "Calculate terms and analyze differences: (5 marks)\n1. n=1: 1² + 3(1) + 1 = 5; n=2: 4 + 6 + 1 = 11; n=3: 9 + 9 + 1 = 19; n=4: 16 + 12 + 1 = 29; n=5: 25 + 15 + 1 = 41 (2 marks)\n2. First differences: 6, 8, 10, 12 (1 mark)\n3. Second differences: 2, 2, 2 (constant) (1 mark)\n4. Second differences are constant because the highest power term is n², and the second difference equals 2a where a is the coefficient of n² (1 mark)",

      "question": "Find the nth term of the quadratic sequence: 4, 11, 22, 37, 56, ...",
      "answer": "Use systematic method for quadratic sequences: (6 marks)\n1. First differences: 7, 11, 15, 19... (1 mark)\n2. Second differences: 4, 4, 4... (constant, confirms quadratic) (1 mark)\n3. Since 2nd diff = 4, coefficient of n² is 4÷2 = 2 (1 mark)\n4. Compare sequence with 2n²: 4-2=2, 11-8=3, 22-18=4, 37-32=5... (1 mark)\n5. This gives arithmetic sequence n+1, so linear part is n+1 (1 mark)\n6. Therefore nth term = 2n² + n + 1 (1 mark)",
